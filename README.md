# GBL - General Base Library

## Introduction
This is a general base library based on modern C++, the goal is:
* generic
* wide coverage
* easy to use
* encapsulate complex, fallible features

I hope that more people can join, design, learn and benefit from it. If you are willing to join us to grow this library, please contact me(13925588730@163.com), I will be very happy and pleased.
