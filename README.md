## Why redbud

Because the university I'm now studying at is [South China Agricultural University](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E5%8D%8E%E5%8D%97%E5%86%9C%E4%B8%9A%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6), the most famous thing of my school is `China redbud`, the code was written during my college year. This is the origin of `redbud`.
