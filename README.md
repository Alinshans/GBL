## Why redbud

Because the university I'm now studying at is [South China Agricultural University](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E5%8D%8E%E5%8D%97%E5%86%9C%E4%B8%9A%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6), the most famous thing of my school is `China redbud`, these codes was written during my college year. This is the origin of `redbud`.

## Contribute

Originally, I wrote these codes for my own use, at the same time, I also hope that more people can **contribute, and benefit from it**. So if you have any ideas or suggestions, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/Alinshans/redbud/issues) or [pull requests](https://github.com/Alinshans/redbud/pulls), I will be very happy and grateful.
